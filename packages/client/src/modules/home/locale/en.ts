const appDescription = `
  This app provides the ability to run colorimetric rapid assays from your
  device. First of all, we are focused on supporting mobile devices, as it
  is very convenient. You have both a data collector (camera) and an
  analyzer (app) in your pocket, making life a lot easier. You no longer
  need to look for color scales - just save them once and you can use
  them.
